# Contacts Frontend with Vue CLI  

## Description 

This is a frontend *only* vue app consuming a third-party API. In particular, this react app is consuming the Django REST API created [here](https://github.com/jlboba/django_rest_api), but this format will work for any seperate server API regardless of what language you built it in.

## Get Set Up Locally 

### On your Browser 

1. Fork this repository to your account 

### In your Terminal 

1. Clone **your fork** of the repo onto your computer anywhere that is not a git repo
1. `cd` into the repo 
1. Touch a `.env` into the root of your project and add a VUE_APP_API_URL value wih the URL to your API. See the .env.sample file for an example of how to set it up
    - Your URL can either be local if you're testing your local API or the deployed url if you're testing the deployed API 
1.Install all the required packages by running: `npm install` 
1. Run the app by running `npm run serve` and you should now be able to see the app on localhost:8080 

### Etc. Notes 

1. To change the title of the browser tab for your app, change it in the `vue.config.js` app

## Deployment

Deployment with Vue CLI is fairly straightforward. You can see the full deployment docs from Vue here and take your choice of where you want to deploy it, then follow their instructions: https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html

My suggestions for deployment, use either of these two: 

- [Netlify](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#netlify)
- [Heroku](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#heroku)
